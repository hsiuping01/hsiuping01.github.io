            <h2>We can easily compose music in this generation</h2>
            <p>
                The evolution of technology has transformed music composition, offering unprecedented opportunities for creativity and innovation on computers. Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)* have become central to the process, providing comprehensive environments for recording, editing, and producing music.<br><br>
                <font size="2">*DAW is a software program that allows you to record, edit, and produce audio. It's essentially a digital recording studio that you can use on your computer.</font>
            </p>

            <h2>Do we need real musical instruments?</h2>
            <p>
                With virtual instruments and sample libraries, composers can access a vast array of realistic sounds without the need for physical instruments, while MIDI* technology enables precise control and manipulation of musical performances.<br><br>
                <font size="2">*MIDI, short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, isn't directly involved in capturing sound like a microphone.<br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, it's a communication protocol that acts as a digital language for electronic instruments, computers, and other musical devices to talk to each other.</font>

                        A device that connects the instruments and microphones to our computer. It essentially translates real-world sounds into a digital format our computer understands and vice versa. This allows us to record our musical ideas, hear them back as we compose, and potentially improve the recording quality.</li>
